I just gave a talk at the <a href="http://sse.se.rit.edu">Society of Software Engineers</a>' <a href="http://sse.se.rit.edu/programs/tech-talks">Tech Talk Thursdays</a> about <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. The talk was a mashup of <a href="http://jointheconversation.org/">Scott Chacon's</a> <a href="http://gitisbetterthanx.com">various</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chacon/getting-git">resources</a> on Git along with <a href="http://michaelhartl.com/">Michael Hartl's</a> <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/content/downloads/ruby2008/presentations/Hartl.pdf">presentation</a> on contributing to <a href="http://insoshi.com">Insoshi</a> with GitHub. I think it went pretty well and it was followed by some good discussion.

The talk is an introduction to Git from the perspective of a student who has used version control before (and hopefully has learned a bit of graph theory). I went over the little history that Git has, why Git rocks, and how helpful and easy it is to use GitHub. Check out the slides: (yes, there's puppies)

It was definitely a lot of fun. (I almost wish someone was taking notes!) Someone was taking a video, so hopefully it'll be up soon. Next time I give the talk I want to show how easy it is to convert from svn/cvs as well as create and browse repositories since I got a lot of suprised looks about <strong>git init</strong> and <strong>git instaweb</strong> during Q&amp;A.
