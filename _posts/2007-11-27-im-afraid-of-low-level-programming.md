It’s running right now. Beneath those fancy windows. Under the hood.
Shifting bits. Moving words in memory. And its scares the crap out of
me.

Why? It’s a facet of human nature: what you don’t understand, you’re
afraid of. But what can a novice programmer do about it? One of the main
reasons I chose software engineering as a major is because I don’t want
to have to think about the lowest level of computing power if I didn’t
need to. I want to solve problems, help the company I’m at succeed, and
enhance my knowledge of the craft.

However, I’m starting to learn that I may need to return to the ‘roots’
of programming. I’m taking a computer graphics course this semester, and
it will be the most C/C programming that I’ve done in a while. Now grant
it, I have had other classes where we did assembly and C, but not the
entire course. It just seems to me that in order to really solve a
problem efficiently, you should understand some of the underpinnings and
inner workings of what you are programming.

So, what’s my solution to this? Well, for now, tinker around with C and
maybe even poke around the

of Nouns</a> ruled by Java and .NET is nice though, and it really does
let you focus on the problem at hand. Sometimes though, I wonder if
escaping from those magical places allows the programmer to really dive
into the task at hand and nail it down. I don’t even want to get into
some of those esoteric languages that

way too much about</a>.

One day I’ll get around to reading

or

this fear? Let me know what you’ve done to get over it.
