I’m wondering where other fellow Ruby and Rails hackers get their
Ruby-related news fix from. For some reason I just feel continually
disconnected from the community at large and I just want to make sure
I’m taking advantage of the resources out there. So here’s my news
sources:

1.  Ruby.Reddit
    (<a href="http://reddit.com/r/ruby">http://reddit.com/r/ruby</a>):
    This seems to be one of the most active sources, and usually the
    commentors are fantastic. It’s community-driven news at its best,
    but sometimes it’s a little slow compared to the other subreddits.
    What I like most about it is that the community is relatively small,
    so if you post a story it usually sticks on the page for a few days.
2.  RubyFlow (<a href="http://rubyflow.com">http://rubyflow.com</a>): I
    just got into RubyFlow recently, and it seems more like the
    community well than anything. You can throw a coin in and wish for
    some visitors to your blog, but you’re usually lost in the mix. It’s
    a very interesting concept though, and it’s definitely fun to see
    big names in the Ruby community on the list.
3.  Ruby.Alltop
    (<a href="http://ruby.alltop.com">http://ruby.alltop.com</a>):
    Alltop is awesome for getting an overall sense of where the
    community is right now. It’s Guy Kawasaki’s ‘magazine rack’ of
    latest Ruby stories…essentially a RSS aggregator. I’ve discovered
    quite a few blogs I didn’t know about and now keep track of through
    it. One of my goals with this blog is to get on there someday! :)

I suppose my secondary news sources would be Freenode’s various Ruby
channels (mostly \#rubyonrails) and the Rails mailing list, but I don’t
check those as often. I’ve also heard about a
<a href="http://caboo.se">secret channel</a>, but who knows if I’ll ever
get in there. Those also don’t have a handy RSS feed, so I tend not to
check them as often. So, where do you get news about the Ruby community
from?
