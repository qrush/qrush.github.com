title: IronRuby drops - make some noise!

A little context about myself and recent events:

1.  I used to be big into .NET before Ruby.
2.  [I decided to move away from .NET over 2 years
    ago.](http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/09/18/switching-to-rails/)
3.  For the past 4 months I’ve been using ASP.NET MVC 2 for my senior
    capstone project.
4.  [IronRuby’s 1.0 release has
    dropped!](http://www.rubyinside.com/ironruby-1-0-released-microsoft-s-3-years-with-ruby-pay-off-3212.html)

This week [Scott Bellware

about why this should matter to anyone doing .NET, especially the
‘forward thinking’ [ALT.NET](http://altdotnet.org) crowd. I’m not too
familiar with the history of the ALT.NET movement, but I love following
smart developers in any sector of our industry on Twitter and I’ve been
watching more .NET devs lately because of my senior project.

Here’s Scott’s main points as I saw it:

-   Comparsions of Rails to ASP.NET MVC 2 are difficult (I agree!)
-   Getting the average .NET developer out of the Visual Studio comfort
    zone is still unlikely
-   You can now painlessly use Ruby and Rails with IIS and .NET in
    general
-   Stop using .NET ports of Ruby projects, you can just run them with
    IronRuby now!

After reading it and seeing [Jason Meridth’s](http://twitter.com/armmer)

…I had to give a Rubyist response. My reaction is: **Welcome!** I don’t
think fear has anything to do with it, it’s just hard to break out of
the norm for any of us. I’m positive you’ll have fun learning Ruby and
integrating with your existing .NET infrastructure.

I’m right behind Scott in that the barrier to entry for those on Windows
and in the .NET ecosystem has been lowered immensely. Plenty have said
it before, but now is the time to start. Many of us have converted over
from C\#/VB.NET, and I can’t be the only one who’s happy to share their
experience with those considering diving into Ruby.

Let me start you off right now:

-   [Rails Guides, a daily reference and great starter
    manual](http://guides.rails.info/)
-   [Railscasts, tons of great recipes in video
    form](http://railscasts.com/)
-   [Rails Tutorial, a book in progress](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
-   [Intro to Sinatra, the classiest web framework
    around](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)

IronRuby has dropped, but you have to make the noise. We Rubyists are
waiting to hear from you!
