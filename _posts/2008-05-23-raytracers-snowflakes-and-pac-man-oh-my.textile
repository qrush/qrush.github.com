So yeah, this is pretty much what I've been up to for the past, oh, 3 months/1 quarter of school. These are a few of the projects I've done for my Computer Graphics 2 class (which I just got an A in, booyah!)

First up, the classic CG application, <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/projects/q-tracer">a ray tracer</a> complete with <a href="http://twitter.com/mittense/statuses/805976194">phongphongphong</a> shading, procedural shading on the floor, reflection, transmission, and even some tone reproduction.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/reinhard88.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-63" title="reinhard88" src="/images/reinhard88-300x233.png" alt="" width="300" height="233" /></a></p>

Secondly, my quarter long personal project, a simple particle system/b-spline curve generator in XNA, dubbed <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/projects/q-blizzard">Q-Blizzard</a>. Turned out to be quite pretty, not exactly configurable though.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/qblizzfinal.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-73" title="qblizzfinal" src="/images/qblizzfinal-300x233.png" alt="" width="300" height="233" /></a></p>

And finally, an image that won me a $25 Barnes and Noble gift certificate in the Pixar Renderman Shader contest. I won third place out of around 30 images! <a href="http://rekaeuqs1.googlepages.com/">My roommate</a> noted that I should have added an <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/nom-nom-nom.jpg">OM NOM NOM</a> caption in for kicks.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/part2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-53" title="part2" src="/images/part2-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

Hopefully this will mark my return to regular blogging (going to try monday, wednesday, friday) for the summer and onward. Hell, if <a href="http://twitter.com/mittense">mittens</a> can keep up his <a href="http://gamedev.net">Daily GameDev.net</a> postings for 2 months, I can do it too. Right? ...Right? (I seem to tell myself every few months or so...)
