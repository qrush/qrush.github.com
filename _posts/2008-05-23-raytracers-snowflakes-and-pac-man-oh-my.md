So yeah, this is pretty much what I’ve been up to for the past, oh, 3
months/1 quarter of school. These are a few of the projects I’ve done
for my Computer Graphics 2 class (which I just got an A in, booyah!)

First up, the classic CG application,
<a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/projects/q-tracer">a ray
tracer</a> complete with
<a href="http://twitter.com/mittense/statuses/805976194">phongphongphong</a>
shading, procedural shading on the floor, reflection, transmission, and
even some tone reproduction.

</p>

Secondly, my quarter long personal project, a simple particle
system/b-spline curve generator in XNA, dubbed
<a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/projects/q-blizzard">Q-Blizzard</a>.
Turned out to be quite pretty, not exactly configurable though.

</p>

And finally, an image that won me a $25 Barnes and Noble gift
certificate in the Pixar Renderman Shader contest. I won third place out
of around 30 images! <a href="http://rekaeuqs1.googlepages.com/">My
roommate</a> noted that I should have added an
<a href="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/nom-nom-nom.jpg">OM
NOM NOM</a> caption in for kicks.

<p style="text-align: center;">

<a href="/images/part2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-53" title="part2" src="/images/part2-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

Hopefully this will mark my return to regular blogging (going to try
monday, wednesday, friday) for the summer and onward. Hell, if
<a href="http://twitter.com/mittense">mittens</a> can keep up his
<a href="http://gamedev.net">Daily GameDev.net</a> postings for 2
months, I can do it too. Right? …Right? (I seem to tell myself every few
months or so…)
