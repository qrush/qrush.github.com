As always, I’m late to jump on the <strike>fail</strike>boat, and this
time I’ve decided to do some serious maintenance on my computer. I’ve
had enough of having to rely on System Restore and worrying that I’ve
lost all of my data, or that my computer is on the brink of death. So,
I’m going to start maintaining my system more, and that’s starting with
keeping my hard drive as tidy and speedy as possible. <!--more-->

My buddy <a href="http://www.theislanddog.com/" target="_blank">Island
Dog</a> pointed me towards a great tool called
<a href="http://www.defraggler.com/">Defraggler</a>, and this started my
journey. Essentially, it allows you to really control the defrag process
from a drive and individual file level. It also includes the color graph
that sadly, Vista removed. Obviously, this tool is pretty much only for
power users, as I’m sure grandma doesn’t even know the slightest about
what a hard drive even is. Partly I’m glad that Vista streamlined the
process of defragmentation, but I have a feeling normal users won’t be
doing it regularly until Windows does it for them or it’s watered down
to one huge button called “Drive Maintenence” that does Disk Cleanup, a
defrag, and whatever else fun stuff Microsoft decides that your drive
needs. For users like me however, I like having a bit of control. Not
too much though, I’m not a
<a href="http://ubergeek.tv/article.php?pid=54">supervillian</a>.

Anyway, Defraggler is a very neat app. It clearly presents the process,
what files need to be moved around, and shows your data being moved
around. It also allows you to switch the process priority from normal to
background so I can actually use my computer during the process. This is
nice for XP, while the visualization helps on Vista. I find the color
graph absolutely fascinating since
<a href="http://www.litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2007/11/27/im-afraid-of-low-level-programming/">I’m
scared to death of low level stuff like this</a>, but my mind does
wonder how defragmentation works under the hood. Maybe someday I will be
a supervillian after all…just definitely not using Linux to control my
orbiting brain lasers.
