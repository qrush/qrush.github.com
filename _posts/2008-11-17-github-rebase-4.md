The latest edition is now up! http://github.com/blog/224-github-rebase-4

I really need to get some of this process sped up and automated.
Currently I have to manually look up all of the repositories, and
creating the table was a bitch. I also need to figure out how to make my
Rails site that processes GitHub’s RSS feed to be multithreaded so it
doesn’t take an hour or two…or three…to figure out what’s going on with
it.
