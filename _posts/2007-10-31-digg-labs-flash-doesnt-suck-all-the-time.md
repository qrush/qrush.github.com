Don’t get me wrong. I’m not an expert on Flash. I haven’t even made
anything special in flash. Yeah, I can tween a circle and bounce it
around the stage, and that’s the extent of my Flash knowledge. One thing
I do know about it: if you want to drive traffic from Google searches,
you’re better off not using it. Some bloggers even claim
<a href="http://www.seoresearcher.com/seo-flash-is-evil-five-big-reasons-not-to-use-flash.htm" target="_blank">its
use to be evil</a>. Now I’m sure there’s a lot of Adobe fans are ready
and willing to tear me a new one by now with arguments about how Flex
and AIR will change the face of the interweb, but it’s my opinion and
always will be that your website’s MAIN content should NEVER be in
Flash. Let’s look at the letters you type into that address bar of your
browser at least once every day:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http" target="_blank">HTTP</a>.
Hyper. Text. Not animations, or effects, but text. Until that protocol
changes I doubt Flash will ever be used as a serious web design
platform.

Once again, don’t get me wrong. Flash has its uses. In fact, it’s
completely changed how we use the web.
<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com" target="_blank">Newgrounds </a>and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> immediately
spring to mind, as they spawned entire communities and one could say
even industries. Flash even has practical uses within sites, such as
<a href="http://swfupload.mammon.se/" target="_blank">SWFUpload</a> or
various visualization tools that are used
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/features.html">even inside of
Google’s own pages</a>.

The real magic of Flash is combining its content together with publicly
available APIs and doing what Flash does best, even better than Java in
some respects: being platform independent.
<a href="http://labs.digg.com" target="_blank">Digg Labs</a> is a
perfect example of this, and their contests are a testament to the real
future of Flash and its real use on the internet. Digg Labs is the
perfect mash-up: content generated by users and displayed in a (semi)
useful, interactive, and fun way. Now, you can even get them to be your
screensaver on Windows or OSX. I tried for a long while to turn some of
the Digg Labs .swf files into screensavers before, but it’s quite a
nightmare without the right tools, and all the right data from the Digg
servers.

What’s so special about Digg Labs creations is that unlike other
visualizations of just raw data, be it traffic to your website or your
network speed shown to you on a speedometer, you can actually interact
with it. You can see the user who just dugg that story, and you can go
check it out for yourself. Yes, it may be flooded with an overwhelming
amount of Ron Paul stories at the moment, but at least it’s not the
HD-DVD encryption key, or even worse.

Other websites out there really need to look into Flash for this
purpose. This is a unique and fun way to engage your community while
providing an actual useful way to access your site’s data. Be it Reddit,
which I would literally love to see an exact clone of Digg Labs for (or
even both together in one app…Blasphemy!), or Facebook, or any Web 2.0
site, they could really use some Flash visualization/interaction apps
that can run on your desktop via a screensaver, Flash executable, or
AIR. Imagine pictures from your friends on Facebook showing up in real
time on your desktop or Del.icio.us links pouring in under a certain tag
in a nice animated fashion. All of the buzz about
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/details-revealed-google-opensocial-to-be-common-apis-for-building-social-apps/">Google’s
Open Social</a> and bringing out more APIs into the public for use makes
this the perfect environment for more Flash goodness like Digg Labs to
happen.

So yeah, Flash doesn’t suck all the time. Its niche on the internet
continues to expand, but some part of me hopes I’ll never have to learn
more than how to move that red circle around the stage.
