…who would they be? I’m following a staggering number of people (1,337
to be exact), and the signal vs. noise ratio is just getting out of
control. I’m not sure how I got into this situation: I just started
following everyone that followed me, and it spun out of control. I see a
few options from here:

1.  Remove everyone and start again.
2.  Set up groups in TweetDeck and continue to follow a ton of people.
3.  Slowly whittle away until my following/follower ratio is down to
    1:1.

This got me thinking…what if you could only follow 10 people? Who would
I follow and why? I present my list, and I encourage you to think of
your own.

1.  <a href="http://twitter.com/ablissfulgal">ablissfulgal</a>: My
    girlfriend. I don’t need to explain this one.
2.  <a href="http://twitter.com/mittense">mittense</a>: Former coworker
    from Stardock who plays way too many video games.
3.  <a href="http://twitter.com/GarrettAtreides">GarrettAtreides</a>:
    Classmate at RIT, MS lover, and all around goofy dude.
4.  <a href="http://twitter.com/AmazingSyco">AmazingSyco</a>: Classmate
    at RIT, Cocoa hacker, and all around funny dude.
5.  <a href="http://twitter.com/chorn">chorn</a>: Local Ruby fan that’s
    a riot. Supposedly he’s a CTO too.
6.  <a href="http://twitter.com/BreakingNewsOn">BreakingNewsOn</a>: For
    those who prefer their news in ALL CAPS.
7.  <a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt">defunkt</a>: One of the
    GitHubbers and an awesome Rubyist.
8.  <a href="http://twitter.com/faithfulgeek">faithfulgeek</a>: Convert
    to the Ruby/OSX world from Microsoft. I’m going through the same
    transition.
9.  <a href="http://twitter.com/nakajima">nakajima</a>: Ruby ninja who’s
    a code machine. And he’s hilarious.
10. <a href="http://twitter.com/guykawasaki">guykawasaki</a>:
    Entrepreneur extraordinaire. I’m listed on his site as a Twitterati
    too.

To those who didn’t make the cut, don’t feel bad! It’s not that I don’t
want to communicate with you, just most likely I can communicate easier
through a different channel (IRC, IM, what have you).
