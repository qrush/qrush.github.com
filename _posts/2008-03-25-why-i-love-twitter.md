I’ve become quite a <a href="http://twitter.com/qrush">twitterholic</a>
the past few days. In fact, let’s
<a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/qrush">check the stats</a>. Yeah,
I’ve been pretty much addicted the past few days. Why? Well, there’s a
few things I love about Twitter:

**Twitter is short, sweet, and easy to use.**

The concept is simple: 140 characters to tell the world what you’re
doing. I don’t think you can get more simple than that. No complex
forms, no huge commitments, just a simple request, and your simple
answer. It has a wonderful web interface, and the settings allow you
completely customize your page’s background along with colors for fonts.
It’s just a breeze to use and easy to look at, which is a welcome change
compared to Facebook or MySpace.<!--more-->

**It’s an awesome way to network with highly connected bloggers.**

I think
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/03/23/the-secret-to-twitter/">Scoble
puts it best</a>:

<blockquote>

You’re communicating to the world that you’d like to be listened to
(golden rule: treat people how you’d like to be treated).

</blockquote>

Twitter is becoming the heart of the
<a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/interblag.png">Interblag</a>. It’s
what bloggers are doing when they’re NOT blogging. Obviously yes, we all
have our jobs and commitments, but Twitter is a way to connect with
those people between their blog, vlogs, or however they communicate with
the internet at large. It’s a way for those who are connected to quickly
poll, grow, and comment with their audience. The value to bloggers to be
active on Twitter is absolutely critical: these are the people who you
WANT to be reading your blog. They’re the people that will link your
blog to others, they know where to share it and who to share it with.
They’re all here folks. Come and find them.

**It’s a great way to keep in touch with friends.**

I think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o">Twitter in
Plain English</a> hits the nail on head: Twitter is a way to converse
with friends in a way that isn’t that important to email them, but
doesn’t necessarily demands their instant attention. Of course now, you
can use Jabber/XMPP to interface with Twitter. Anyway, I find it to be a
neat way to keeping in touch with people I know in the real world online
that isn’t exactly bugging them over AIM or Facebook. Also, if you’re
concerned about random people like me following your every move, you can
make your page private and only allow those you approve to watch your
updates.

**It’s just fun to use!**

What really gets me with this are the

<a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">net</a>. The Twitter API is readily
accessible and easy to implement, and that’s extremely important as it
seems that most people use twitter through outside clients or through
text messaging rather than their web interface. My personal favorite at
the moment is <a href="http://www.twhirl.org">Twhirl</a>, which is an
Adobe AIR client. It’s got a neat, clean interface and colors are
customizable, so I’m having fun with it. I rarely have to go to the
website anymore, the API is so open that the majority of the
functionality is accessible through outside clients.

So, why haven’t you created a
<a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> account yet? I guarantee
you that it’ll do nothing but help you get your blog known, and connect
with others who are on the same quest. Feel free to
