I came across [this post](http://www.iamcal.com/lego-carcassonne/) on making a [Carcassone](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne) tile set out of Lego bricks yesterday. The post talks about how the individual tiles were designed and rendered, and ends with a sad conclusion: a real set would cost over $2,000. To make matters worse, the [Lego Digital Designer (LDD)](http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/)'s [DESIGN byME](http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/subpages/designbyme) site has been out of commission for a while now.

The post was updated with a 7x7 tileset, and I thought it could go even smaller, which would result in a more realistic price. I fired up the LDD, and several hours later...

It's a functioning set of all 24 tiles! It was a ton of fun to build this. Playing with the LDD is like having an infinite pile of Legos, and there's no diving through looking for that one piece: you can just search for it!

I borrowed a few design elements from other sets:

* "Layered" effect like the 7x7 set
* Fantastic color choices from the 9x9 set
* Shrunk shield from 7x7 set down
* Just one blue base, so [The River](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18836/carcassonne-the-river-ii) could be added later

I connected the tiles together and it looks like a real game would not only work, but it definitely gives the "map" feel that Carcassone is great at:

If you generated a set of all 72 tiles, it clocks in at 975 pieces. Toss in 40 [microfigs](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=M&catString=252) and a scoreboard, and this could be an actual Lego set:

LDD even generates instructions for you, too! [Read the play-by-play](http://quaran.to/lego-carcassonne) of building this set (once GitHub Pages processes it), and check out the models for yourself [on GitHub](https://github.com/qrush/lego-carcassonne). I'd love to play a game on one of these someday.

So, how could that happen? [Cuusoo](http://lego.cuusoo.com)? Kickstarter? Hunting down the pieces individually via [Bricklink](http://www.bricklink.com/) feels like a huge hassle. Also, the colors chosen are all not available, so it might be impossible to order this in the current color palette. If you have suggestions, let me know [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/qrush)!
